Assignment 4: Image Processor


To use our image processor, simply run the main method from IntelliJ, or run the ImageProcessing.jar file from the command line (java -jar ImageProcessing.jar).
If you want to use the terminal image processor, run the command line argument java -jar ImageProcessing.jar -text, and if you want to run a script, user java -jar ImageProcessing.jar -file <path to script>.

All parts of our program are complete such as concrete classes and tests, but there is flexibility so that different terminal controllers, gui controllers, models, views, and guis can be added in the future if needed. 


CHANGES:

We did not modify our existing code, but we added the following elements:

ImageProcessorGUI: we created a completely new interface for a GUI view because it had nothing in common with our other view.
ImageProcessorGUIBasic: This was our concrete implementation of the ImageProcessorGUI interface.
Histogram: We created a separate histogram class to represent and display a histogram.
Listener: We created our own implementation of a Listener so that our Controller wouldn't need to know anything about javax.swing.
GUIController: this was our concrete implementation of our Listener interface and it handles interactions between the gui and the model.
Tests: we added tests for the GUIController but nothing else, since we were not able to test the gui.


The "koala", "sixbit" and “25bit” directories in the "res" folder are images used for testing. The
"blerner-examples" folder contains example images generated by running our program.
"Test" also contains images obtained by running our program.
